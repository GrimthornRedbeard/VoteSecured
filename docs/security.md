#### Vote Encryption Protocol
```python
# Pseudocode for vote encryption
def encrypt_vote(vote, public_key):
    # Generate random nonce
    nonce = generate_secure_random(256)
    
    # Encrypt vote with AES-256-GCM
    encrypted_vote = AES_GCM_encrypt(vote, nonce)
    
    # Sign encrypted vote
    signature = RSA_PSS_sign(encrypted_vote, private_key)
    
    # Return encrypted ballot
    return {
        'encrypted_vote': encrypted_vote,
        'signature': signature,
        'nonce': nonce,
        'timestamp': current_timestamp()
    }
```

#### Input Validation
```python
# Example input validation
def validate_ballot_input(ballot_data):
    # Check data types and ranges
    if not isinstance(ballot_data, dict):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid ballot format")
    
    # Sanitize inputs
    for key, value in ballot_data.items():
        ballot_data[key] = sanitize_input(value)
    
    # Validate against election configuration
    if not is_valid_ballot_structure(ballot_data):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid ballot structure")
    
    return ballot_data
```

#### Security Headers
```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
